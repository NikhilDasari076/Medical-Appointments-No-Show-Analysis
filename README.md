# Medical-Appointments-No-Show-Analysis

Medical Appointments No-Show Analysis
This project analyzes a dataset of 110,527 medical appointments to identify factors influencing patient no-shows and provide actionable recommendations.

Key Highlights:
Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering: Processed raw data, handled invalid entries, converted dates, and created delay-based features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends in demographics, SMS reminders, and scheduling delays using Python libraries.
Predictive Modeling: Built an XGBoost model achieving a ROC AUC score of 0.7377, with delays and SMS reminders as key predictors of no-shows.
Actionable Insights: Suggested improvements to communication, scheduling practices, and targeted outreach campaigns to reduce no-show rates.
Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
Jupyter Notebook
